    Simplify Ukraine metadata
    
    This does not change timestamps; it merely simplifies the source.
    Suggested by Michael Deckers in:
    https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2022-February/031186.html
    * europe (Ukraine): Remove Rule, as C-Eur suffices.
    (Europe/Simferopol, Europe/Kiev, Europe/Uzhgorod, Europe/Zaporozhye):
    Use C-Eur instead of Ukraine.
